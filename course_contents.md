## Lesson: The skills that set you apart
**Q: It's important to know what do data scientists actually do, to do that, juno has experience working as data scientists in practice, Juno, can you give us a little insight into what your role look like as a data scientist?**  
A1: I was a data scientist at a smaller startup. So I have different roles. About 20 percent of my role was more in business analytics and actually I worked a lot with the software development team, to make sure that before I did any data science, the data that was being recorded was clean and standardized so that it made sense. I gave things like activity reports on what kind of users and products were happening at the time. About 80 percent of my role was on longer-term data science projects, where i worked on a recommender system, and recommended different products to users, and make sense of the information we have in our database, such as clusters of similar products we had or insights for our users.  
A2: I was a data scientist at a large company. most of the time my audience is very technical customers. so it was important for me to make sure that they understood what they were going to get from what we were working on, from a business perspective.

# 2. Introduction to data science
## Lesson 1: The data science Process

The guide on how to approach future data science problems.

Given the large number of industries and problems that fall under the umbrella of Data Science,
there are a lot of different tools and individual nuances of a particular company or industry for finding solutions.  
However, there's actually a common process used to find many solutions in Data Science. This process is known as the **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM**            
This process has been an industry standard for analyzing data for years and it has six major phases:
1. **developing business understanding.**
2. **developing data understanding.**
3. **prepping your data to be analyzed.**
4. **modeling the data.**
5. **evaluating the results to answer your questions of interest.**
6. **deploying changes based on the results of your analysis.**

**Business understanding:**  
Are you interested in acquiring new customers?  
Are you interested in assessing of a new cancer treatment outperforms existing treatments?  
Are you interested in finding a better way to communicate, or travel, or retain information?

**Data understanding:**  
This means you need to gain an understanding of
the data necessary to answer your question.  
Sometimes you might have **a mountain of data** at
your disposal that you need to **dig through** to find insights.  
Other times you may need to **collect data**,
which means you will have to **understand what kind of data we'll be able to provide** you with the insights you need.
This is often difficult to know ahead of time,
which is **why businesses tend to collect all the data they can first**,
so they can later identify which data they need to use to find their insights.
