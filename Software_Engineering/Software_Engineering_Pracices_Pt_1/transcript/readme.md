## 1. Introduction
Welcome to part one of Software Engineering Practices. Here, we will go over a few techniques that we can adopt as data scientists to be better developers and prepare for production level code. You will learn how to write clean and modular code, improve your code's efficiency, document effectively, and use version control. These are all essential skills to develop as a programmer and will really help you when implementing production solutions. In addition, data scientists often work side-by-side with software engineers, and it's important you work well together. This means being familiar with standard practices and being able to collaborate effectively with others on code. Let's walk through each of these practices and learn how they're applied as a data scientist.
## 2. Clean and Modular Code
The first practice we'll talk about, is writing code in a way that is clean and modular. Data scientists often struggle with this when they first start coding, or even if they've been coding for years in a more research or academic setting. When you're working in industry, your code could potentially be used in production. Production code just means code that is run on production servers. For example, when you're on your laptop using software products like Udacity, Google, or Amazon, the code that's running the service you're using is production code. Ideally, code that's being used in production should meet a number of criteria to ensure reliability and efficiency before it becomes public. For one, the code needs to be clean. Code is clean when it's readable, simple and concise. Here's an example in plain English of a sentence that is not clean. "One could observe that your shirt has been sullied, due to the orange color of your shirt that appears to be similar to the color of a certain kind of juice." This sentence is terribly redundant and convoluted. Just reading this makes me frustrated. This can be rewritten as, "It looks like you spilled orange juice on your shirt," and accomplish the same thing. But this sentence is much more concise and clear. Writing clean code is very important in an industry setting where on a team that's constantly iterating over its work. This makes it much easier for yourself and others to understand and reuse your code. In addition to being clean, your code should be modular. Meaning, your program is logically broken up into functions and modules. In programming, a module is just a python file. Similarly to how you can encapsulate code in a function and reuse it by calling the function in different places, you can encapsulate code within a module or file and reuse it by importing it in other files. We will see examples of this later. To you get a better understanding of what modular code is, try to think of it as putting your clothes away. Sure, you could just put all of your clothes in a single jar, but it wouldn't be very easy to find anything. Maybe because you can't ever find anything, you have multiple versions of the same shirt or socks because you repurchased them when you couldn't find them. It will be much better if instead, you had a drawer for tee-shirts, another one for just shirts, another for socks, and so on. With this design, if you need a nice outfit for an interview, you don't need to worry about buying one just because he couldn't find the right clothes. If you need to tell someone else how to find the right shirt, pants, and pair of socks, it will be much easier with this design. The same is true in writing modular code. Splitting a code into logical functions and modules, allows you to quickly find a relevant pieces of code. You can often generalize these pieces of code to be reused in different places, to prevent yourself from writing extra unnecessary lines of code. Abstracting out these details into these functions and modules can really help in improving the readability of your code. Again, programming in a way that makes it easier for a team to understand and iterate on is crucial for production. In this lesson, you will get practice writing code that is clean and modular to help you accomplish this.
## 3. Refactoring Code
When you first sit down to start writing code for a new idea or task, it's easy to pay little attention to writing good code and focus more on just getting it to work. So, your code typically gets a little messy and repetitive at this stage of development. This is okay. It's hard to know what's the best way to write your code before it's finished. For example, it could be difficult to know exactly what functions would best modularize the steps in your code if you haven't experimented enough with your code to understand what these steps are. That's why you should always go back to do some refactoring after you've achieved a working model. Code refactoring is a term for restructuring your code to improve its internal structure without changing its external functionality. Refactoring gives you an opportunity to clean and modularize your code after you've produced code that works. In the short-term, you might see this as a waste of time, since you could be moving on to the next feature. However, allocating time to refactoring your code really speeds up the time it will take you and your team to develop code in the long run. Refactoring your code consistently not only makes it much easier to come back to it later, it also allows you to reuse parts for different tasks and learn strong programming techniques along the way. The more you practice refactoring your code, the more intuitive it becomes. You'll start to find yourself writing more organized code on your first pass, with less to reorganize when you go back. Let's take a look at a couple of examples and get some practice.
