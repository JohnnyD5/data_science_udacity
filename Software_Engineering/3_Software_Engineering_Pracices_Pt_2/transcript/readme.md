## 1. Testing
Before you can deploy your code, it will need to be tested. Writing tests is standard practice in software engineering. However, testing is often a practice many data scientists aren't familiar with when they first start in industry. In fact, sometimes the insights data scientists come up with, which are supposed to be used for business decisions and company products, are based on the results of untested code. This lack of testing is a common complaint from other software developers working with data scientists. Without testing, not only do you run into execution errors in code due to software issues, you could also be dictating business decisions and affect products based on faulty conclusions. Today, employers are looking for data scientists with the skills to properly prepare their code for an industry setting, which means tested code. 

It's pretty obvious when a software program crashes. You get an error, and the program stops running. However, there are many problems that could occur in the data science process that aren't as easily detectable as a functional error that crashes your program. All of your code can seem to run smoothly with you completely unaware that certain values will be encoded incorrectly, features are being used inappropriately, or unexpected data were breaking assumptions that your statistical models are based on. These errors are more difficult to find because you have to check for the quality and accuracy of your analysis in addition to the quality of your code. Therefore, it's essential that you had proper testing to avoid unexpected surprises and have confidence in your results. In fact, testing has proven to have so many benefits that there's an entire development process based on it called Test Driven Development. This is a development process where you write test for tasks before you even write the code to implement those tasks. We'll talk more about this later. For now, we will get some practice writing tests, specifically unit test. A unit test is a type of test that covers a unit of code, usually a single function independently from the rest of the program. First, you'll learn how to write unit tests in plain Python, and then how we can use additional tools to make them better. Finally, you'll see examples of types of tests you will see in data science.
